<p>It has been said that the Scot is never so much at home as when he is
abroad. Under this half-jesting reference to one of the
characteristics of our race, there abides a sober truth, namely, that
the Scotsman carries with him from his parent home into the world
without no half-hearted acceptance of the duties required of him in
the land of his adoption. He is usually a public-spirited citizen, a
useful member of society, wherever you find him. But that does not
lessen the warmth of his attachment to the place of his birth, or the
land of his forbears. Be his connection with Scotland near or remote,
there is enshrined in the inner sanctuary of his heart, memories,
sentiments, yearnings, that are the heritage of generations with whom
love of their country was a dominant passion, and pride in the deeds
that her children have done an incentive to effort and an antidote
against all that was base or ignoble.</p>

<p>It is a fact that goes to the core of the secular struggle for human
freedom that whole-hearted Americanism finds no jarring note in the
sentiment of the Scot, be that sentiment ever so intense. In the
sedulous cultivation of the Scottish spirit there is nothing alien,
and, still more emphatically, nothing harmful, to the institutions
under which we live. The things that nourish the one, engender
attachment and loyalty to the other. So, as we cherish the memories of
the Motherland, keep in touch with the simple annals of our
childhood's home, or the home of our kin, bask in the fireside glow of
its homely humor, or dwell in imagination amid the haunts of old
romance, we are the better Americans for the Scottish heritage from
which heart and mind alike derive inspiration and delight.</p>

<p>It is as difficult to separate the current of Scottish migration to
the American Colonies, or to the United States that grew out of them,
from the larger stream which issued from England, as it is to
distinguish during the last two hundred years the contributions by
Scotsmen from those of Englishmen to the great body of English
literature. We have the first census of the new Republic, in the year
1790, and an investigator who classified this enumeration according to
what he conceived to be the nationality of the names, found that the
total free, white, population numbering 3,250,000 contained 2,345,844
people of English origin; 188,589 of Scottish origin, and 44,273 of
Irish origin. <a name="Page_4" id="Page_4" />The system of classification is manifestly loose, and
the distribution of parent nationalities entirely at variance with
known facts. That part of the population described as Irish was
largely Ulster-Scottish, the true Irish never having emigrated in any
considerable numbers until they felt the pressure of the potato
famine, fifty years later. There is excellent authority for the
statement that, at the outbreak of the Revolutionary War one-third of
the entire population of Pennsylvania was of Ulster-Scottish origin. A
New England historian, quoted by Whitelaw Reid, counts that between
1730 and 1770 at least half a million souls were transferred from
Ulster to the Colonies&mdash;more than half of the Presbyterian population
of Ulster&mdash;and that at the time of the Revolution they made one-sixth
of the total population of the nascent Republic. Another authority
fixes the inhabitants of Scottish ancestry in the nine Colonies south
of New England at about 385,000. He counts that less than half of the
entire population of the Colonies was of English origin, and that
nearly, or quite one-third of it, had a direct Scottish ancestry.</p>

<p>These conclusions find powerful support in the number of distinguished
men whom the Scots and the Ulstermen contributed to the Revolutionary
struggle, and to the public life of the early days of the United
States. Out of Washington's twenty-two brigadier generals, nine were
of Scottish descent, and one of the greatest achievements of the
war&mdash;the rescue of Kentucky and the whole rich territory northwest of
the Ohio, from which five States were formed&mdash;was that of General
George Rogers Clark, a Scottish native of Albert County, Virginia.
When the Supreme Court of the United States was first organized by
Washington three of the four Associate Justices were of the same
blood&mdash;one a Scot and two Ulster-Scots. When the first Chief Justice,
John Jay, left the bench, his successor, John Rutledge, was an
Ulster-Scot. Washington's first cabinet contained four members&mdash;two of
them were Scotch and the third was an Ulster-Scot. Out of the
fifty-six members who composed the Congress that adopted the
Declaration of Independence eleven were of Scottish descent. It was in
response to the appeal of a Scot, John Witherspoon, that the
Declaration was signed; it is preserved in the handwriting of an
Ulster-Scot who was Secretary of the Congress; it was first publicly
read to the people by an Ulster-Scot, and first printed by a third
member of the same vigorous body of early settlers.</p>

<p>George Bancroft will hardly be accused of holding a brief for the Scot
in American history but, with all his New England predilections, he
frankly records this conclusion: &quot;We shall find the first voice
publicly raised in America to dissolve all connection with Great
Britain, came not from the Puritans of New England, or the Dutch of
New <a name="Page_5" id="Page_5" />York, or the planters of Virginia, but from Scotch-Irish
Presbyterians.&quot; It was Patrick Henry, a Scot, who kindled the popular
flame for independence. The foremost, the most irreconcilable, the
most determined in pushing the quarrel to the last extremity, were
those whom the bishops and Lord Donegal &amp; Company had been pleased to
drive out of Ulster.</p>

<p>The distinguished place which men of Scottish or of Ulster origin had
asserted for themselves in the councils of the Colonies was not lost
when the Colonies became independent States. Among the first of the
thirteen original States two-thirds were of either Scottish or
Ulster-Scottish origin. Of the men who have filled the great office of
President of the United States, eleven out of the whole twenty-five
come under the same category. About half the Secretaries of the
Treasury of the Government of the United States have been of Scottish
descent, and nearly a third of the Secretaries of State.</p>

<p>But it is perhaps in the intangible things that go to the making of
national character that the Scottish contribution to the making of
America has been most notable. In 1801, the population of the whole of
Scotland was but little over a million and a half, and behind that
there were at least eight centuries of national history. Behind that,
too, were all the long generations of toil and strife in which the
Scottish character was being molded into the forms that Scott and
Burns made immortal. It is a character full of curious contrasts, with
its strong predilection for theology and metaphysics on one side, and
for poetry and romance on the other. Hard, dry and practical in its
attitude to the ordinary affairs of life, it is apt to catch fire from
a sudden enthusiasm, as if volatility were its dominant note and
instability its only fixed attribute. And so it has come about that
side by side with tomes of Calvinistic divinity, there has been
transmitted to Scotsmen an equally characteristic product of the mind
of their race&mdash;a body of folksong, of ballad poetry, of legend and of
story in that quaint and copious Doric speech which makes so direct an
appeal to the hearts of men whether they are to the manner born or
not. It is surely a paradox that a nation which, in the making, had
the hardest kind of work to extract a scanty living from a stubborn
soil, and still harder work to defend their independence, their
liberties, their faith from foes of their own kindred, should be best
known to the world for the romantic ideals they have cherished and the
chivalrous follies for which their blood has been shed.</p>

<p>But, it is well to remember that long before the Reformers of the
sixteenth century founded the parish school system of Scotland, the
monasteries had their schools and so had the parish churches; there
were high schools in the burghs and song schools of remarkable
excellence. <a name="Page_6" id="Page_6" />The light of learning may have waxed dim at times, but it
was not from an illiterate land that Scottish scholars carried into
Europe all through the Middle Ages the name and fame of their country,
any more than it was from a people unversed in the arts of war that
Scottish soldiers went abroad to fight foreign battles, giving now a
Constable to France, a General-in-Chief to Russia and still again a
Lieutenant to Gustavus Adolphus. If evidence were needed of the vigor
of the Scottish race, it is readily forthcoming in the fact that for
five hundred years the Land O'Cakes enriched the world with the
surplus of her able men.</p>

<p>Nurse of heroes, nurse of martyrs, nurse of freemen, are titles which
belong of right to our Motherland and she has been justified of her
children, at home and abroad. The rolls of honor of many countries and
many climes bear their names; there is no field of distinction whether
it be of thought or of action that has not witnessed their triumphs.
That Scotland has yielded more than her share of the men who have gone
forth to the conquest of the world is largely due to the fact that it
was part of her discipline that men must first conquer themselves. The
weakest of them felt that restraining influence, and the striving
after the Scottish ideal, however feeble, has been a protection
against sinking into utter baseness. The most wayward scions of the
Scottish family have known that influence, and have borne testimony to
the beauty of the homely virtues which they failed to practice and the
nobility of aspirations which fell short of controlling their life.</p>

<p>It belongs to the character and antecedents of Scotsmen that the
attribute of national independence should take so high a place among
the objects of human effort and desire. It was because Scotland
settled for all time, six hundred years ago, her place as an
independent State that she proved herself capable of begetting men
like John Knox, Robert Burns and Walter Scott. It is because the vigor
of the Scottish race and the adaptiveness of the Scottish genius
remain to-day unimpaired, that the lustre of Scottish-names shone so
brilliantly during the World War. It may be confidently asserted that,
whether regarded as a race or a people no members of the great
English-speaking family did more promptly, more cheerfully or more
courageously make the sacrifices required to perform their full part
in the struggle to defend the freedom that belongs to our common
heritage and to preserve the ideals without which we should not regard
life as worth living. The union, centuries old, in the Scottish mind
and heart of the most uncompromising devotion to individual liberty
with the most fervid patriotism, is a sentiment of which the world
stands greatly in need to-day. We need not go far to find evidence <a name="Page_7" id="Page_7" />of
how perilous it is to sink regard for the great conception of human
brotherhood in a narrow, nationalistic concern for individual
interests. In the Scottish conception of liberty, <i>duties</i> have always
been rated as highly as <i>rights</i>; it has been a constructive, not a
destructive formula; it has been an inspiration to raise men out of
themselves, not to prompt them to indulge in antics of promiscuous
leveling. The kind of democracy for which Scotsmen have deemed that
the world should be made safe is a human brotherhood, indeed, but a
brotherhood imbued with the generous rivalry of effort, the enthusiasm
of emulous achievement, and not one of inglorious, monotonous and
colorless equality.</p>

<h2><a name="SCOTTISH_EMIGRATION_TO_THE_AMERICAN_COLONIES" id="SCOTTISH_EMIGRATION_TO_THE_AMERICAN_COLONIES" /><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11" />SCOTTISH EMIGRATION TO THE AMERICAN COLONIES</h2>


<p>Scottish emigration to America came in two streams&mdash;one direct from
the motherland and the other through the province of Ulster in the
north of Ireland. Those who came by this second route are usually
known as &quot;Ulster Scots,&quot; or more commonly as &quot;Scotch-Irish,&quot; and they
have been claimed as Irishmen by Irish writers in the United States.
This is perhaps excusable but hardly just. Throughout their residence
in Ireland the Scots settlers preserved their distinctive Scottish
characteristics, and generally described themselves as &quot;the Scottish
nation in the north of Ireland.&quot; They, of course, like the early
pioneers in this country, experienced certain changes through the
influence of their new surroundings, but, as one writer has remarked,
they &quot;remained as distinct from the native population as if they had
never crossed the Channel. They were among the Irish but not of them.&quot;
Their sons, too, when they attended the classes in the University of
Glasgow, signed the matriculation register as &quot;A Scot of Ireland.&quot;
They did not intermarry with the native Irish, though they did
intermarry to some extent with the English Puritans and with the
French Huguenots. (These Huguenots were colonies driven out of France
by the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, and induced to
settle in the north of Ireland by William III. To this people Ireland
is indebted for its lace industry, which they introduced into that
country.)</p>

<p>Again many Irish-American writers on the Scots Plantation of Ulster
have assumed that the Scots settlers were entirely or almost of Gaelic
origin, ignoring the fact, if they were aware of it, that the people
of the Scottish lowlands were &quot;almost as English in racial derivation
as if they had come from the North of England.&quot; Parker, the historian
of Londonderry, New Hampshire, speaking of the early Scots settlers in
New England, has well said: &quot;Although they came to this land from
Ireland, where their ancestors had a century before planted
themselves, yet they retained unmixed the national Scotch character.
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12" />Nothing sooner offended them than to be called Irish. Their antipathy
to this appellation had its origin in the hostility then existing in
Ireland between the Celtic race, the native Irish, and the English and
Scotch colonists.&quot; Belknap, in his <i>History of New Hampshire</i> (Boston,
1791) quotes a letter from the Rev. James MacGregor (1677-1729) to
Governor Shute in which the writer says: &quot;We are surprised to hear
ourselves termed Irish people, when we so frequently ventured our all
for the British Crown and liberties against the Irish papists, and
gave all tests, of our loyalty, which the government of Ireland
required, and are always ready to do the same when demanded.&quot;</p>

<p>Down to the present day the descendants of these Ulster Scots settlers
living in the United States who have maintained an interest in their
origin, always insist that they are of Scottish and not of Irish
origin. On this point it will be sufficient to quote the late Hon.
Leonard Allison Morrison, of New Hampshire. Writing twenty-five years
ago he said: &quot;I am one of Scotch-Irish blood and my ancestor came with
Rev. McGregor of Londonderry, and neither <i>they</i> nor any of their
descendants were willing to be called 'merely Irish.' I have twice
visited,&quot; he adds, &quot;the parish of Aghadowney, Co. Londonderry, from
which they came, in Ireland, and all that locality is filled, not with
'Irish' but with Scotch-Irish, and this is pure Scotch blood to-day,
after more than <i>200</i> years.&quot; The mountaineers of Tennessee and
Kentucky are largely the descendants of these same Ulster Scots, and
their origin is conclusively shown by the phrase used by mothers to
their unruly children: &quot;If you don't behave, Clavers [i.e.,
Claverhouse] will get you.&quot;</p>

<p>If we must continue to use the hyphen when referring to these early
immigrants it is preferable to use the term &quot;Ulster Scot&quot; instead of
&quot;Scotch-Irish,&quot; as was pointed out by the late Whitelaw Reid, because
it does not confuse the race with the accident of birth, and because
the people preferred it themselves. &quot;If these Scottish and
Presbyterian colonists,&quot; he says, &quot;must be called Irish because they
had been one or two generations in the north of Ireland, then the
Pilgrim Fathers, who had been one generation or more in Holland, must
by the same reasoning be called Dutch or at the very least English
Dutch.&quot;</p>

<p>To understand the reasons for the Scots colonization of Ulster and the
replantation in America it is necessary to look back three centuries
in British history. On the crushing of the Irish rebellion under Sir
Cahir O'Dogherty in 1607 about 500,000 acres of forfeited land in the
province of Ulster were at the disposal of the crown. At the
suggestion of King James the I. of England, Ulster was divided into
lots and offered to colonists from England. Circumstances, however,
turned <a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" />what was mainly intended to be an English enterprise into a
Scottish one. Scottish participation &quot;which does not seem to have been
originally regarded as important,&quot; became eventually, as Ford points
out, the mainstay of the enterprise. &quot;Although from the first there
was an understanding between [Sir Arthur] Chichester and the English
Privy Council that eventually the plantation would be opened to Scotch
settlers, no steps were taken in that direction until the plan had
been matured ... The first public announcement of any Scottish
connection with the Ulster plantation appears in a letter of March 19,
1609, from Sir Alexander Hay, the Scottish secretary resident at the
English Court, to the Scottish Privy Council at Edinburgh.&quot; In this
communication Hay announced that the king &quot;out of his unspeikable love
and tindir affectioun&quot; for his Scottish subjects had decided that they
were to be allowed a share, and he adds, that here is a great
opportunity for Scotland since &quot;we haif greitt advantaige of
transporting of our men and bestiall [i.e., live stock of a farm] in
regairde we lye so neir to that coiste of Ulster.&quot; Immediately on
receipt of this letter the Scottish Privy Council made public
proclamation of the news and announced that those of them &quot;quho ar
disposit to tak ony land in Yreland&quot; were to present their desires and
petitions to the Council. The first application enrolled was by &quot;James
Andirsoun portionair of Litle Govane,&quot; and by the 14th of September
seventy-seven Scots had come forward as purchasers. If their offers
had been accepted, they would have possessed among them 141,000 acres
of land. In 1611, in consequence of a rearrangement of applicants the
number of favored Scots was reduced to fifty-nine, with eighty-one
thousand acres of land at their disposal. Each of these &quot;Undertakers,&quot;
as they were called, was accompanied to his new home by kinsmen,
friends, and tenants, as Lord Ochiltree, for instance, who is
mentioned as having arrived &quot;accompanied with thirty-three followers,
a minister, some tenants, freeholders, [and] artificers.&quot; By the end
of 1612 the emigration from Scotland is estimated to have reached
10,000. Indeed, before the end of this year so rapidly had the traffic
increased between Scotland and Ireland that the passage between the
southwest of Scotland and Ulster &quot;is now become a commoun and are
ordinarie ferrie,&quot; the boat-men of which were having a rare time of it
by charging what they pleased for the passage or freight. In the
selection of the settlers measures were carefully taken that they
should be &quot;from the inwards part of Scotland,&quot; and that they should be
so located in Ulster that &quot;they may not mix nor intermarry&quot; with &quot;the
mere Irish.&quot; For the most part the settlers appear to have been
selected from the shires of Dumbarton, Renfrew, Ayr, Galloway, and
Dumfries. Emigration from Scotland to Ireland appears to have
continued steadily and the <a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" />English historian Carte estimated, after
diligent documentary study, that by 1641 there were in Ulster 100,000
Scots and 20,000 English settlers. In 1656 it was proposed by the
Irish government that persons &quot;of the Scottish nation desiring to come
into Ireland&quot; should be prohibited from settling in Ulster or County
Louth, but the scheme was not put into effect. Governmental opposition
notwithstanding emigration from Scotland to Ireland appears to have
continued steadily, and after the Revolution of 1688 there seems to
have been a further increase. Archbishop Synge estimated that by 1715
not less than 50,000 Scottish families had settled in Ulster during
these twenty-seven years. It should be also mentioned that &quot;before the
Ulster plantation began there was already a considerable Scottish
occupation of the region nearest to Scotland. These Scottish
settlements were confined to counties Down and Antrim, which were not
included in the scheme of the plantation. Their existence facilitated
Scottish emigration to the plantation and they were influential in
giving the plantation the Scottish character which it promptly
acquired. Although planned to be in the main an English settlement,
with one whole county turned over to the city of London alone, it soon
became in the main a Scottish settlement.&quot;</p>

<p>The Scots were not long settled in Ulster before misfortune and
persecution began to harass them. The Irish rebellion of 1641, said by
some to have been an outbreak directed against the Scottish and
English settlers, regarded by the native Irish as intruders and
usurpers, caused them much suffering; and Harrison says that for
&quot;several years afterward 12,000 emigrants annually left Ulster for the
American plantations.&quot; The Revolution of 1688 was also long and bloody
in Ireland and the sufferings of the settlers reached a climax in the
siege of Londonderry (April to August, 1688). They suffered also from
the restrictions laid upon their industries and commerce by the
English government. These restrictions, and later the falling in of
leases, rack-renting by the landlords, payment of tithes for support
of a church with which they had no connection, and several other
burdens and annoyances, were the motives which impelled emigration to
the American colonies from 1718 onwards. Five ships bearing seven
hundred Ulster Scots emigrants arrived in Boston on August 4, 1718,
under the leadership of Rev. William Boyd. They were allowed to select
a township site of twelve miles square at any place on the frontiers.
A few settled at Portland, Maine, at Wicasset, and at Worcester and
Haverhill, Massachusetts, but the greater number finally at
Londonderry, New Hampshire. In 1723-4 they built a parsonage and a
church for their minister, Rev. James MacGregor. In six years they had
four schools, and within nine years Londonderry paid one-fifteenth <a name="Page_15" id="Page_15" />of
the state tax. Previous to the Revolution of 1776 ten distinct
settlements were made by colonists from Londonderry, N.H., all of
which became towns of influence and importance. Notable among the
descendants of these colonists were Matthew Thornton, Henry Knox, Gen.
John Stark, Hugh McCulloch, Horace Greeley, Gen. George B. McClellan,
Salmon P. Chase, and Asa Gray. From 1771 to 1773 &quot;the whole emigration
from Ulster is estimated at 30,000 of whom 10,000 were weavers.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1706 the Rev. Cotton Mather put forth a plan to settle hardy Scots
families on the frontiers of Maine and New Hampshire to protect the
towns and churches there from the French and Indians, the Puritans
evidently not being able to protect themselves. He says, &quot;I write
letters unto diverse persons of Honour both in Scotland and in
England; to procure Settlements of Good Scotch Colonies, to the
Northward of us. This may be a thing of great consequence;&quot; and
elsewhere he suggests that a Scottish colony might be of good service
in getting possession of Nova Scotia. In 1735, twenty-seven families,
and in 1753 a company of sixty adults and a number of children,
collected in Scotland by General Samuel Waldo, were landed at George's
River, Maine. In honor of the ancient capital of their native country,
they named their settlement Stirling.</p>

<p>Another and an important cause of the early appearance of Scots in
America was the wars between Scotland and England during the
Commonwealth. Large numbers of Scottish prisoners taken at Dunbar
(1650) and at Worcester (1651) were sold into service in the colonies,
a shipload arriving in Boston Harbor in 1652 on the ship <i>John and
Sara</i>. The means taken to ameliorate their condition led in 1657 to
the foundation of the Scots Charitable Society of Boston&mdash;the earliest
known Scottish society in America. Its foundation may be taken as
evidence that there were already prosperous and influential Scots
living in Boston at that time. A list of the passengers of the <i>John
and Sara</i> is given in Suffolk <i>Deed Records</i> (bk. 1, pp. 5-6) and in
Drake's <i>The Founders of New England</i> (Boston, 1860, pp. 74-76). These
men, says Boulton, &quot;worked out their terms of servitude at the Lynn
iron works and elsewhere, and founded honorable families whose Scotch
names appear upon our early records. No account exists of the Scotch
prisoners that were sent to New England in Cromwell's time; at York in
1650 were the Maxwells, McIntires, and Grants. The Mackclothlans
[i.e., Mac Lachlans], later known as the Claflins, gave a governor to
Massachusetts and distinguished merchants to New York City.&quot;</p>

<p>The bitter persecution of Presbyterians during the periods of
episcopal rule in the latter half of the seventeenth century also
contributed <a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" />largely to Scottish emigration to the new world. A
Scottish merchant in Boston named Hugh Campbell, obtained permission
from the authorities of the Bay State Colony in February 1679-80 to
bring in a number of settlers from Scotland and to establish them in
the Nepmug country in the vicinity of Springfield, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>So desperate had matters become in Scotland at the beginning of the
eighth decade of the seventeenth century that a number of the nobility
and gentry determined to settle in New Jersey and the Carolinas. One
of these colonies was founded in New Jersey in 1682 under the
management of James Drummond, Earl of Perth, John Drummond, Robert
Barclay the Quaker Apologist, David and John Barclay, his brothers,
Robert Gordon, Gawen Lawrie, and George Willocks. In 1684 Gawen
Lawrie, who had been for several years previously residing in the
colony, was appointed Deputy Governor of the province, and fixed his
residence at Elizabeth. In the same year Perth (so named in honor of
the Earl of Perth, one of the principal proprietors, now Perth Amboy)
was made the capital of the new Scottish settlement. During the
following century a constant stream of emigrants both from Scotland
and from Ulster came to the colony. One of the principal encouragers
of the Scottish colony in New Jersey was George Scot or Scott (d.
1685) of Pitlochrie, who had been repeatedly fined and imprisoned by
the Privy Council of Scotland for attending &quot;Conventicles,&quot; as
clandestine religious gatherings were then called in Scotland, and in
the hope of obtaining freedom of worship in the new world he proposed
to emigrate &quot;to the plantations.&quot; To encourage others to do the like
he printed at Edinburgh (1685) a work, now very rare, called &quot;The
Model of the Government of the Province of East New Jersey, in
America; and Encouragement for Such as Design to be concerned there.&quot;
Scot received a grant of five hundred acres in recognition of his
having written the work, and sailed in the <i>Henry and Francis</i> for
America. A malignant fever broke out among the passengers and nearly
half on board perished including Scot and his wife. A son and daughter
survived and the proprietors a year after issued a confirmation of the
grant to Scot's daughter and her husband (John Johnstone), many of
whose descendants are still living in New Jersey.</p>

<p>Walter Ker of Dalserf, Lanarkshire, banished in 1685, settled in
Freehold, and was active in organizing the Presbyterian Church there,
one of the oldest in New Jersey. The Scots settlers who came over at
this period occupied most of the northern counties of the state but
many went south and southwest, mainly around Princeton, and, says
Samuel Smith, the first historian of the province, &quot;There were very
soon four towns in the Province, viz., Elizabeth, Newark, Middletown
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" />and Shrewsbury; and these with the country round were in a few years
plentifully inhabited by the accession of the Scotch, of whom there
came a great many.&quot; These Scots, says Duncan Campbell, largely gave
&quot;character to this sturdy little state not the least of their
achievements being the building up if not the nominal founding of
Princeton College, which has contributed so largely to the scholarship
of America.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1682 another company of nobles and gentlemen in Scotland arranged
for a settlement at Port Royal, South Carolina. These colonists
consisted mainly of Presbyterians banished for attending
&quot;Conventicles.&quot; The names of some of these immigrants, whose
descendants exist in great numbers at the present day, included James
McClintock, John Buchanan, William Inglis, Gavin Black, Adam Allan,
John Gait, Thomas Marshall, William Smith, Robert Urie, Thomas Bryce,
John Syme, John Alexander, John Marshall, Matthew Machen, John Paton,
John Gibson, John Young, Arthur Cunningham, George Smith, and George
Dowart. The colony was further increased by a small remnant of the
ill-fated expedition to Darien. One of the vessels which left Darien
to return to Scotland, the <i>Rising Sun</i>, was driven out of its course
by a gale and took refuge in Charleston. Among its passengers was the
Rev. Archibald Stobo, who was asked by some people in Charleston to
preach in the town while the ship was being refitted. He accepted the
invitation and left the ship with his wife and about a dozen others.
The following day, the <i>Rising Sun</i>, while lying off the bar, was
overwhelmed in a hurricane and all on board were drowned. This Rev.
Archibald Stobo was the earliest American ancestor of the late
Theodore Roosevelt's mother. In the following year (1683) the colony
was augmented by a number of Scots colonists from Ulster led by one
Ferguson. A second Scottish colony in the same year under Henry
Erskine, Lord Cardross, founded Stuartstown (so named in honor of his
wife). Another colony from Ulster was that of Williamsburgh township
(1732-34), who named their principal village Kingstree.</p>

<p>There were settlements of Scots Highlanders in North Carolina, on the
Cape Fear River, as early as 1729; some indeed are said to have
settled there as early as 1715. Neill McNeill of Jura brought over a
colony of more than 350 from Argyllshire in 1739, and large numbers in
1746, after Culloden, and settled them on the Cape Fear River. Cross
Creek, now Fayetteville, was the center of these Highland settlements,
and hither came the Scottish heroine, Flora MacDonald, in 1775. The
mania for emigration to North Carolina affected all classes in
Scotland and continued for many years. The <i>Scots Magazine</i> for May
1768 records that a number of settlers from the <a name="Page_18" id="Page_18" />Western Isles had
embarked for Carolina and Georgia, including forty or fifty families
from Jura alone. In September of following year it is stated that a
hundred families of Highlanders had arrived at Brunswick, North
Carolina, and &quot;two vessels are daily expected with more.&quot; In August
1769 the ship <i>Mally</i> sailed from Islay full of passengers for North
Carolina, which was the third or fourth emigration from Argyll &quot;since
the conclusion of the late war.&quot; In August 1770 it was stated that
since the previous April six vessels carrying about twelve hundred
emigrants had sailed from the western Highlands for North Carolina. In
February of the following year the same magazine states that five
hundred souls in Islay and adjacent islands were preparing to emigrate
to America in the following summer. In September of the same year
three hundred and seventy persons sailed from Skye for North Carolina,
and two entries in the magazine for 1772 record the emigration of
numbers from Sutherland and Loch Erribol. In the same year a writer
says the people who have emigrated from the Western Isles since the
year 1768 &quot;have carried with them at least ten thousand pounds in
specie. Notwithstanding this is a great loss to us, yet the
depopulation by these emigrations is a much greater.... Besides, the
continual emigrations from Ireland and Scotland, will soon render our
colonies independent on the mother-country.&quot; In August, 1773, three
gentlemen of the name of Macdonell, with their families and four
hundred Highlanders from Inverness-shire sailed for America to take
possession of a grant of land &quot;in Albany.&quot; On the 22d of June
previously between seven and eight hundred people from the Lewis
sailed from Stornoway for the colonies. On the first of September,
1773, four hundred and twenty-five men, women and children from
Inverness-shire sailed for America. &quot;They are the finest set of
fellows in the Highlands. It is allowed they carried at least 6000
pounds Sterling in ready cash with them.&quot; In 1774 farmers and heads of
families in Stirlingshire were forming societies to emigrate to the
colonies and the fever had also extended to Orkney and Shetland and
the north of England. In 1753 it was estimated that there were one
thousand Scots in the single county of Cumberland capable of bearing
arms, of whom the Macdonalds were the most numerous. Gabriel Johnston,
governor of the province of North Carolina from 1734 to 1752, appears
to have done more to encourage the settlement of Scots in the colony
than all its other colonial governors combined.</p>

<p>In 1735 a body of one hundred and thirty Highlanders with fifty women
and children sailed from Inverness and landed at Savannah in January
1736. They were under the leadership of Lieutenant Hugh Mackay. Some
Carolinians endeavoured to dissuade them from going <a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" />to the South by
telling them that the Spaniards would attack them from their houses in
the fort near where they were to settle, to which they replied, &quot;Why,
then, we will beat them out of their fort, and shall have houses ready
built to live in.&quot; &quot;This valiant spirit,&quot; says Jones, &quot;found
subsequent expression in the efficient military service rendered by
these Highlanders during the wars between the Colonists and the
Spaniards, and by their descendants in the American Revolution. To
John 'More' McIntosh, Captain Hugh Mackay, Ensign Charles Mackay, Col.
John McIntosh, General Lachlan McIntosh, and their gallant comrades
and followers, Georgia, both as a Colony and a State, owes a large
debt of gratitude. This settlement was subsequently augmented from
time to time by fresh arrivals from Scotland.... Its men were prompt
and efficient in arms, and when the war cloud descended upon the
southern confines of the province no defenders were more alert or
capable than those found in the ranks of these Highlanders.&quot; &quot;No
people,&quot; says Walter Glasco Charlton, &quot;ever came to Georgia who took
so quickly to the conditions under which they were to live or remained
more loyal to her interests&quot; than the Highlanders. &quot;These men,&quot; says
Jones, &quot;were not reckless adventurers or reduced emigrants
volunteering through necessity, or exiled through insolvency or want.
They were men of good character, and were carefully selected for their
military qualities.... Besides this military band, others among the
Mackays, the Dunbars, the Baillies, and the Cuthberts applied for
large tracts of land in Georgia which they occupied with their own
servants. Many of them went over in person and settled in the
province.&quot;</p>

<p>Among the immigrants who flocked into Virginia in 1729 and 1740 we
find individuals named Alexander Breckinridge, David Logan, Hugh
Campbell, William Graham, James Waddell (the &quot;Blind Preacher&quot;), John
McCue, Benjamin Erwin, Gideon Blackburn, Samuel Houston, Archibald
Scott, Samuel Carrack, John Montgomery, George Baxter, William
McPheeters, and Robert Poage (Page?), and others bearing the names of
Bell, Trimble (Turnbull), Hay, Anderson, Patterson, Scott, Wilson, and
Young. John McDowell and eight of his men were killed by Indians in
1742. Among the members of his company was his venerable father
Ephraim McDowell. In 1763 the Indians attacked a peaceful settlement
and carried off a number of captives. After traveling some distance
and feeling safe from pursuit they demanded that their captives should
sing for their entertainment, and it was a Scotswoman, Mrs. Gilmore,
who struck up Rouse's version of the one hundred and thirty-seventh
psalm:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" />
<span>&quot;By Babel's streams we sat and wept,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">When Zion we thought on,<br /></span>
<span>In midst thereof we hanged our harps<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The willow tree thereon.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;For there a song required they,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Who did us captive bring;<br /></span>
<span>Our spoilers called for mirth, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i3">'A song of Zion sing.'&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the following year Colonel Henry Bouquet led a strong force against
the Indians west of the Ohio, and compelled them to desist from their
predatory warfare, and deliver up the captives they had taken. One of
his companies was made up of men from the Central Valley of Virginia,
largely composed of Scots or men of Ulster Scot descent, and commanded
by Alexander McClanahan, a good Galloway surname. Ten years later
occurred the battle of Point Pleasant when men of the same race under
the command of Andrew Lewis defeated the Shawnee Indians.</p>

<p>In January 1775, the freeholders of Fincastle presented an address to
the Continental Congress, declaring their purpose to resist the
oppressive measures of the home government. Among the signers were
William Christian, Rev. Charles Cummings, Arthur Campbell, William
Campbell, William Edmundson, William Preston and others. Several other
counties in the same state, inhabited mainly by Scots or people of
Scottish descent, adopted like resolutions. During the Revolutionary
war, in addition to large numbers of men of Scottish origin serving in
the Continental army from this state, the militia were also constantly
in service under the leadership of such men as Colonels Samuel
McDowell, George Moffett, William Preston, John and William Bowyer,
Samson Mathews, etc.</p>

<p>The following Scots were members of His Majesty's Council in South
Carolina under the royal government, from 1720 to 1776: Alexander
Skene, James Kinloch (1729), John Cleland, James Graeme, George Saxby,
James Michie, John Rattray (1761), Thomas Knox Gordon, and John
Stuart. Andrew Rutledge was Speaker of the Commons' House of Assembly
from 1749 to 1752. David Graeme, attorney at law in 1754, was
Attorney-General of the State from 1757 to 1764. James Graeme, most
probably a relation of the preceding, was elected to the Assembly from
Port Royal in 1732, became Judge of the Court of Vice Admiralty from
1742 to 1752, and Chief Justice from 1749 to 1752. James Michie was
Speaker of the Assembly from 1752 to 1754, Judge of the Court of
Admiralty from 1752 <a name="Page_21" id="Page_21" />to 1754, and Chief Justice from 1759 to 1761.
William Simpson served as Chief Justice 1761-1762. Thomas Knox Gordon
was appointed Chief Justice in 1771 and served till 1776, and in 1773
he also appears as Member of Council. John Murray was appointed
Associate Justice in 1771 and died in 1774. William Gregory was
appointed by His Majesty's mandamus to succeed him in 1774. Robert
Hume was Speaker of the Assembly in 1732-1733. Robert Brisbane was
Associate Justice in 1764, and Robert Pringle appears in the same
office in 1760 and 1766. John Rattray was Judge of the Court of
Vice-Admiralty in 1760-61, and James Abercrombie appears as
Attorney-General in 1731-32. James Simpson was Clerk of the Council in
1773, Surveyor-General of Land in 1772, Attorney-General in 1774-75,
and Judge of Vice-Admiralty in the absence of Sir Augustus Johnson in
1769. John Carwood was Assistant Justice in 1725. Thomas Nairne was
employed in 1707 &quot;as resident agent among the Indians, with power to
settle all disputes among traders ... to arrest traders who were
guilty of misdemeanors and send them to Charleston for trial, to take
charge of the goods of persons who were committed to prison, and to
exercise the power of a justice of the peace.&quot; This Thomas Nairne is
probably the same individual who published, anonymously, &quot;A letter
from South Carolina; giving an account of the soil ... product ...
trade ... government [etc.] of that province. Written by a Swiss
Gentleman to his friend at Bern,&quot; the first edition of which was
published in London in 1710 (second ed. in 1732).</p>

<p>Among the names of the seventeen corporate members of the Charleston
Library Society established in 1743 occur those of the following
Scots: Robert Brisbane, Alexander M'Cauley, Patrick M'Kie, William
Logan, John Sinclair, James Grindlay, Alexander Baron, and Charles
Stevenson.</p>

<p>Of the members of the Provincial Congress held at Charleston in
January, 1775, the following were Scotsmen or men of Scottish
ancestry: Major John Caldwell, Patrick Calhoun (ancestor of
Vice-President Calhoun), George Haig of the family of Bemersyde,
Charles Elliott, Thomas Ferguson, Adam Macdonald, Alexander M'Intosh,
John M'Ness, Isaac MacPherson, Col. William Moultrie, David Oliphant,
George Ross, Thomas Rutledge, James Sinkler, James Skirving, senior,
James Skirving, junior, William Skirving, and Rev. William Tennent.</p>

<p>In Maryland there seems to have been a colony of Scots about 1670
under Colonel Ninian Beall, settled between the Potomac and the
Patuxent, and gradually increased by successive additions. Through his
influence a church was established at Patuxent in 1704, the members
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" />of which included several prominent Fifeshire families. Many other
small Scottish colonies were settled on the eastern shore of Maryland
and Virginia, particularly in Accomac, Dorchester, Somerset, Wicomico,
and Worcester counties. To minister to them the Rev. Francis Makemie
and the Rev. William Traill were sent out by the Presbytery of Laggan
in Ulster. Upper Marlborough, Maryland, was founded by a company of
Scottish immigrants and were ministered to by the Rev. Nathaniel
Taylor, also from Scotland.</p>

<p>Two shiploads of Scottish Jacobites taken at Preston in 1716 were sent
over in the ships <i>Friendship</i> and <i>Good Speed</i> to Maryland to be sold
as servants. The names of some of these sufficiently attest their
Scottish origin, as, Dugall Macqueen, Alexander Garden, Henry Wilson,
John Sinclair, William Grant, Alexander Spalding, John Robertson,
William MacBean, William McGilvary, James Hindry, Allen Maclien,
William Cummins, David Steward, John Maclntire, David Kennedy, John
Cameron, Alexander Orrach [Orrock?], Finloe Maclntire, Daniel Grant,
etc. Another batch taken in the Rising of the '45 and also shipped to
Maryland include such names as John Grant, Alexander Buchanan, Patrick
Ferguson, Thomas Ross, John Cameron, William Cowan, John Bowe, John
Burnett, Duncan Cameron, James Chapman, Thomas Claperton, Sanders
Campbell, Charles Davidson, John Duff, James Erwyn, Peter Gardiner,
John Gray, James King, Patrick Murray, William Melvil, William
Murdock, etc.</p>

<p>A strong infusion of Scottish blood in New York State came through
settlements made there in response to a proclamation issued in 1735 by
the Governor, inviting &quot;loyal protestant Highlanders&quot; to settle the
lands between the Hudson River and the northern lakes. Attracted by
this offer Captain Lauchlin Campbell of Islay, in 1738-40, brought
over eighty-three families of Highlanders to settle on a grant of
thirty thousand acres in what is now Washington County. &quot;By this
immigration,&quot; says E.H. Roberts, &quot;the province secured a much needed
addition to its population, and these Highlanders must have sent
messages home not altogether unfavorable, for they were the pioneers
of a multitude whose coming in successive years were to add strength
and thrift and intelligence beyond the ratio of their numbers to the
communities in which they set up their homes.&quot; Many Scottish
immigrants settled in the vicinity of Goshen, Orange County, in 1720,
and by 1729 had organized and built two churches. A second colony
arrived from the north of Ireland in 1731. At the same time as the
grant was made to Lauchlin Campbell, Lieutenant-Governor Clarke
granted to John Lindsay, a Scottish gentleman, and three associates, a
tract of eighty thousand acres in Cherry Valley, in Otsego County.
Lindsay afterwards purchased the rights of his associates <a name="Page_23" id="Page_23" />and sent
out families from Scotland and Ulster to the valley of the
Susquehanna. These were augmented by pioneers from Londonderry, New
Hampshire, under the Rev. Samuel Dunlop, who, in 1743 established in
his own house the first classical school west of the Hudson. Ballston
in Saratoga County was settled in 1770 by a colony of Presbyterians
who removed from Bedford, New York, with their pastor, and were
afterwards joined by many Scottish immigrants from Scotland, Ulster,
New Jersey, and New England. The first Presbyterian Church was
organized in Albany in 1760 by Scottish immigrants who had settled in
that vicinity.</p>

<p>Sir William Johnson for his services in the French War (1755-58)
received from the Crown a grant of one hundred thousand acres in the
Mohawk Valley, near Johnstown, which he colonized with Highlanders in
1773-74.</p>

<p>In New York City about the end of the eighteenth century there was a
colony of several hundred Scottish weavers, mainly from Paisley. They
formed a community apart in what was then the village of Greenwich. In
memory of their old home they named the locality &quot;Paisley Place.&quot; A
view of some of their old dwellings in Seventeenth Street between
Sixth and Seventh Avenues, as they existed in 1863, is given in
Valentine's <i>Manual</i> for that year.</p>

<p>Although many Scots came to New England and New York they never
settled there in such numbers as to leave their impress on the
community so deeply as they did in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
and the south. There were Presbyterian churches in Lewes, Newcastle
(Delaware), and Philadelphia previous to 1698, and from that time
forward the province of Pennsylvania was the chief centre of Scottish
settlement both from Scotland direct and by way of Ulster. By 1720
these settlers had reached the mouth of the Susquehanna, and three
years later the present site of Harrisburg. Between 1730 and 1745 they
settled the Cumberland Valley and still pushing westward, in 1768-69
the present Fayette, Westmoreland, Allegheny, and Washington counties.
In 1773 they penetrated to and settled in Kentucky, and were followed
by a stream of Todds, Flemings, Morrisons, Barbours, Breckinridges,
McDowells, and others. By 1790 seventy-five thousand people were in
the region and Kentucky was admitted to the Federal Union in 1792. By
1779 they had crossed the Ohio River into the present state of Ohio.
Between the years 1730 and 1775 the Scottish immigration into
Pennsylvania often reached ten thousand a year.</p>

<p>Lord Bacon expressed his regret that the lives of eminent men were not
more frequently written, and added that, &quot;though kings, princes, and
great personages be few, yet there are many excellent men who deserve
better fate than vague reports and barren elegies.&quot; Of no country is
this more true than the United States. An examination of the
innumerable early biographical dictionaries with which the shelves of
our public libraries are cumbered, will show that the bulk of the life
sketches of the individuals therein commemorated are vague and
unsatisfactory. In nearly every case little or no information is given
of the parentage or origin of the subject, and indeed one work goes so
far as to say that such information is unnecessary, the mere fact of
American birth being sufficient. However pleasing such statements may
be from an ultra patriotic viewpoint it is very unsatisfactory from
the biological or historical side of the question, which is
undoubtedly the most important to be considered. The neglect of these
items of origin, etc., makes the task of positively identifying
certain individuals as of Scottish origin or descent a very difficult
one. One may feel morally certain that a particular individual from
his name or features (if there be a portrait) is of Scottish origin,
but without a definite statement to that effect the matter must in
most cases be left an open question. One other cause of uncertainty,
and it is a very annoying one, is the careless method of many
biographers in putting down a man's origin as &quot;Irish,&quot; &quot;from Ireland,&quot;
&quot;from the north of Ireland,&quot; etc., where they clearly mean to state
that the individual concerned is descended from one of the many
thousands of Scots who settled in Ulster in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. Notwithstanding this uncertainty the proportion
of men of undoubted Scottish origin who have reached high distinction,
and whose influence has had such far reaching scope in the United
States, is phenomenal. &quot;Let anyone,&quot; says Dinsmore, &quot;scrutinize the
list of names of distinguished men in our annals; names of men eminent
in public life from President down; men distinguished in the Church,
in the Army, in the Navy, at the Bar, on the Bench, in Medicine and
Surgery, in Education, trade, commerce, invention, discovery&mdash;in any
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25" />and all of the arts which add to the freedom, enlightenment, and
wealth of the world, and the convenience and comfort of mankind; names
which have won luster in every honorable calling&mdash;let him scrutinize
the list&quot; and he will be astonished to find how large a proportion of
these names represent men of Scottish birth or Scottish descent. In
these pages it is obviously impossible to mention every Scot who has
achieved distinction&mdash;to do so would require a large biographical
dictionary. We can here only select a few names in each class from
early colonial times to the present day.</p>

<p>The most famous family of Colonial times was that of the Livingstons
of Livingston Manor, famed alike for their ability and their
patriotism. The first of the family in America was Robert Livingston
(1654-1725), born at Ancrum, Roxburghshire, who came to America about
1672. He married Alida (Schuyler) Van Rensselaer. His eldest son,
Philip (1686-1749), second Lord of the Manor, succeeded him and added
greatly to the family wealth and lands by his business enterprise.
Peter Van Brugh Livingston (1710-92), second son of Philip, was
President of the first Provincial Congress. Another son, Philip
(1716-78), was Member of the General Assembly for the City of New
York, Member of Congress in 1774 and 1776, and one of the Signers of
the Declaration of Independence. A third son was William (1723-90),
Governor of New Jersey. Other prominent members of this family were
Robert R. Livingston (1746-1813), and Edward (1764-1836). The former
was Member of the Continental Congress, Chancellor of the State of New
York (1777-1801), Secretary of Foreign Affairs (1781-83), Minister to
France (1801-05), and Negotiator of the Louisiana Purchase (1803). He
administered the oath of office to George Washington on his assuming
the office of President. Edward was Member of Congress from New York
(1795-1801), Mayor of New York City (1801-03), Member of Congress from
Louisiana (1823-29), United States Senator (1829-31), Secretary of
State (1831-33), and Minister to France (1833-35). Robert Fulton, the
inventor, married a daughter of the Livingstons and thus got the
necessary financial backing to make the <i>Clermont</i> a success. A sister
of Edward was married to General Montgomery of Quebec fame, another to
Secretary of War Armstrong, and a third to General Morgan Lewis.</p>

<p>The Bells of New Hampshire descended from John Bell, the Londonderry
settler of 1718, gave three governors to New Hampshire and one to
Vermont. Luther V. Bell, formerly Superintendent of the McLean Asylum,
Somerville, Massachusetts, was another of his descendants. The McNutts
of Londonderry, New Hampshire, are descended from William McNaught,
who settled there in 1718. The McNaughts <a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" />came originally from
Kilquhanite in Galloway. The Bean family, descended from John Bean who
came to America in 1660, were pioneers in new settlements in New
Hampshire and Maine, and bore the burden of such a life and profited
by it. About one hundred of them were soldiers in the Revolutionary
War. The Macdonough family of Delaware is also of Scottish descent.
Thomas Macdonough, the famous naval officer, was of the third
generation in this country. The Corbit family of Delaware are
descended from Daniel Corbit, a Quaker born in Scotland in 1682. The
Forsyths of Georgia are descended from Robert Forsyth, born in
Scotland about 1754, who entered the Congressional Army and became a
Captain of Lee's Light Horse in 1776. The Forsyths of New York State
trace their descent to two brothers from Aberdeenshire (John and
Alexander). The bulk of the Virginia Gordons appear to have been from
Galloway.</p>

<p>Alexander Breckenridge, a Scot, came to America about 1728, settling
in Pennsylvania and later in Virginia. One of his sons, Robert, was an
energetic Captain of Rangers during the Indian wars, and died before
the close of the Revolutionary War. By his second wife, also of
Scottish descent, he had several sons who achieved fame and success.
One of these sons, John Breckenridge (1760-1808), became
Attorney-General of Kentucky in 1795; served in the state legislature
1797-1800; drafted the famous Kentucky resolutions in 1798; was United
States Senator from Kentucky (1801-05) and Attorney-General in
Jefferson's Cabinet from 1805 till his death. Among the sons of John
Breckenridge were Robert Jefferson Breckenridge (1800-71), clergyman
and author, and Joseph Cabell Breckenridge. John Cabell Breckenridge,
son of Joseph C. Breckenridge, was Vice-President of the United States
(1857-61), candidate of the Southern Democrats for President in 1860,
General in the Confederate Armies (1862-64), Confederate Secretary of
War till 1865. Joseph Cabell Breckenridge (b. 1840), son of Robert J.
Breckenridge, also served with distinction in the Civil War, and took
an active part in the Santiago campaign during the Spanish-American
War. Henry Breckenridge (b. 1886), son of Joseph C. Breckenridge, was
Assistant Secretary of War, and served with the American Expeditionary
Forces in the Argonne. William Campbell Preston Breckenridge
(1837-1904), son of Robert J. Breckenridge, was Member of the
Forty-ninth Congress.</p>

<p>The descendants of James McClellan, kin of the McClellans of Galloway,
Scotland, who was appointed Constable at the town meeting held in
Worcester in March, 1724, have written their name large in the medical
and military annals of this country. Some of his descendants are
noticed under Physicians. The most famous of the family was General
George Brinton MacClellan (1826-85), Major-General <a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" />in the United
States Army during the Civil War, unsuccessful candidate of the
Democratic Party for President in 1864, and Governor of New Jersey
from 1878 to 1881. The General's son, George B. McClellan (b. 1865),
was Mayor of New York (1903 and 1905) and is now a Professor in
Princeton. James Bulloch, born in Scotland c. 1701, emigrated to
Charleston, South Carolina, c. 1728. In the following year he married
Jean Stobo, daughter of the Rev. Archibald Stobo, and was the first
ancestor of the late President Roosevelt's mother. His son, Archibald
Bulloch (d. 1777), was Colonial Governor of Georgia and Commander of
the State's forces in 1776-77, and signed the first Constitution of
Georgia as President. He would have been one of the Signers of the
Declaration of Independence had not official duties called him, home.
A descendant of his, James Dunwoody Bulloch, uncle of the late
President Roosevelt, was Lieutenant in the Confederate Navy and
Confederate States Naval Agent abroad. Irvine S. Bulloch, another
uncle of Roosevelt's, was Sailing Master of the Alabama when in battle
with the U.S.S. Kearsarge. Another of this family was William B.
Bulloch (1776-1852), lawyer and State Senator of Georgia. The Chambers
family of Trenton, New Jersey, are descended from two brothers, John
and Robert Chambers, who came over in the ship <i>Henry and Francis</i> in
1685.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century many natives of Dumfriesshire emigrated to
the American colonies, and of these perhaps the most prominent were
those descended from John Johnston of Stapleton, Dumfriesshire, an
officer in a Scottish regiment in the French service. His second son,
Gabriel, became Governor of North Carolina. In the house of the
Governor's brother, Gilbert, it is stated that General Marion signed
the commission for the celebrated band known as &quot;Marion's Men.&quot; Among
the more prominent descendants of Gilbert Johnston are: (1) James, who
became a Colonel on the staff of General Rutherford during the
Revolution and served in several engagements; (2) William, M.D., who
married a daughter of General Peter Forney, and died in 1855. This
William had five sons: (1) James, a Captain in the Confederate Army;
(2) Robert, a Brigadier-General; (3) William, a Colonel; (4) Joseph
Forney, born in 1843, Captain in the Confederate Army, Governor of
Alabama from 1896 to 1900, and United States Senator for Alabama in
1907; (5) Bartlett, an officer in the Confederate Navy. Samuel
Johnston, a nephew of Gilbert's, was the Naval Officer of North
Carolina in 1775, Treasurer during the Revolution, and Governor of
North Carolina from 1787 to 1789, President of the Convention that
finally adopted the State Constitution, and first Senator elected by
his state in the United States Congress in 1789. His son, James, was
the largest planter in the <a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" />United States on his death in 1865.
Gilbert's brother Robert, was an attorney and civil engineer. His son,
Peter, served as Lieutenant in the legion which Colonel Henry Lee
recruited in Virginia, and after the war became Judge of the
South-Western Circuit in Virginia, and Speaker of the Virginia House
of Delegates. He married Mary Wood, a niece of Patrick Henry. Their
eighth son, Joseph Eccleston Johnston, born in 1807, graduated from
West Point in 1829, served in the Federal Army in all its campaigns,
up to the time of the Civil War. Although holding the rank of
Lieutenant-Colonel and Quarter-Master-General, he resigned and joined
the Confederate Army, and rendered brilliant service in its ranks.
Another eminent individual of this name was General Albert Sydney
Johnston, the son of a physician, John Johnston, the descendant of a
Scottish family long settled in Connecticut. Christopher Johnston
(1822-1891), a descendant of the Poldean branch of the Annandale
Johnstons, was professor of surgery in the University of Maryland. His
son, also named Christopher (d. 1914), graduated M.D., practised for
eight years, studied ancient and modern languages, and eventually
became Professor of Oriental History and Archaeology in Johns Hopkins
University. He was one of the most distinguished Oriental scholars
this country has produced.</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton (1757-1804), one of the founders of the Republic,
served with distinction in the Revolutionary War, but it was as a
Statesman of the highest ability that he acquired his great fame. He
was one of the most prominent Members of the Continental Congress
(1782-83), of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and Secretary of
the Treasury (1789-95). He was born in the West Indies, the son of a
Scots father and a French mother.</p>

<p>Thomas Leiper (1745-1825), born in Strathaven, Lanarkshire, emigrated
to Maryland in 1763, was one of the first to favor separation from the
mother country, and raised a fund for open resistance to the Crown.</p>

<p>Robert Stuart (1785-1848), pioneer and fur-trader, born at Callander,
Perthshire, a grandson of Rob Roy's bitterest enemy. In 1810, in
company with his uncle, John Jacob Astor, and several others, he
founded the fur-trading colony of Astoria. His share in this
undertaking is fully described in Washington Irving's <i>Astoria</i>. In
1817 Stuart settled at Mackinac as agent of the American Fur Company,
and also served as Commissioner for the Indian tribes. General George
Bartram, of Scottish parentage, was one of the &quot;Committee of
Correspondence&quot; appointed to take action on the &quot;Chesapeake Affair&quot; in
1807, when war with Britain seemed imminent, and was active in
military affairs during the war of 1812. Allan Pinkerton (1819-84),
born in the Gorbals, Glasgow, organized the United States <a name="Page_29" id="Page_29" />Secret
Service Division of the United States Army in 1861, discovered the
plot to assassinate President Lincoln on his way to his inauguration
in 1861, and also broke up the &quot;Molly Maguires,&quot; etc. William Walker
(1824-60), the filibuster, was born in Tennessee of Scots parentage.</p>

<p>Rev. George Keith, a native of Aberdeen, became Surveyor-General of
New Jersey in 1684. He founded the town of Freehold and marked out the
dividing line between East and West Jersey. In 1693 he issued the
first printed protest against human slavery, &quot;An Exhortation &amp; Caution
to Friends concerning Buying and Keeping of Negroes,&quot; New York, 1693.
James Alexander (1690-1756), a Scot, was disbarred for attempting the
defense of John Peter Zenger, the printer, in 1735. Along with
Benjamin Franklin he was one of the founders of the American
Philosophical Society. Andrew Hamilton (1676-1741), the most eminent
lawyer of his time, Attorney-General of Pennsylvania, and chief
Commissioner for building Independence Hall in Philadelphia, was born
in Scotland. For his championship of the freedom of the press and his
successful defense of Zenger he was hailed by Governor Morris as &quot;the
day-star of the Revolution.&quot; His son James Hamilton, was the first
native-born Governor of Pennsylvania and Mayor of Philadelphia. James
Breghin or Brechin, Missionary, born in Scotland, took a prominent
part in the affairs of Virginia (1705-19) and was an active supporter
of Commissary Blair. Charles Anderson, another Missionary, probably a
graduate of Aberdeen, served in Virginia from 1700 to 1719, was also a
supporter of Blair. James Graham, first Recorder of the city of New
York (1683-1700) and Speaker of Assembly (1691-99) was born in
Scotland. Thomas Gordon (d. Perth Amboy, 1722), born in Pitlochrie,
was Attorney-General of the Eastern District (1698), Chief Secretary
and Registrar in 1702, later Speaker of Assembly, and in 1709 Chief
Justice and Receiver-General and Treasurer of the province. Alexander
Skene, who previously held office in Barbadoes, settled in North
Carolina about 1696. In 1717 he was Member of Council and Assistant to
the Judge of Admiralty to try a number of pirates. In 1719 he was
elected Member of the New House of Assembly and became leader of the
movement for the Proprietary Government. He was &quot;looked upon as a man
that understood public affairs very well.&quot; Major Richard Stobo
(1727-c. 1770), a native of Glasgow, served in the Canadian campaign
against the French. It was he who guided the Fraser Highlanders up the
Heights of Abraham. Archibald Kennedy (c. 1687-1763), a relative of
the Earl of Cassilis, was Collector of Customs of the Port of New York
and Member of the Provincial Council. In his letters to headquarters
and in his reports he urged <a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" />the importance of the American Colonies
to the mother country and advocated measures which, if carried out,
would undoubtedly have strengthened their loyalty and added to their
wealth and prosperity. Alexander Barclay, grandson of the Apologist of
the Quakers, was Comptroller of the Customs under the Crown in
Philadelphia from 1762 till his death in 1771. William Ronald, a
native of Scotland, was a delegate in the Virginia Convention of 1788.
His brother, General Andrew Ronald, was one of the Counsel
representing the British merchants in the so-called British Debts
Case. William Houston, son of Sir Patrick Houston, was a Delegate to
the Continental Congress (1784-87) and a Depute from Georgia to the
Convention for revising the Federal Constitution. His portrait, as
well as that of his brother's, was destroyed by fire during the Civil
War. Sir William Dunbar (c. 1740-1810), a pioneer of Louisiana, held
important trusts under the Federal government and was a correspondent
of Thomas Jefferson. Rev. Henry Patillo (1736-1801), born in Scotland,
advocated separation from the mother country on every possible
occasion, and was a Member of the Provincial Council in 1775. John
Dickinson (1732-1808), Member of the Continental Congress of 1765, of
the Federal Convention of 1787, and President of Pennsylvania
(1782-85), was also the founder of Dickinson College, Carlisle,
Pennsylvania. The Dickinsons came from Dundee in early colonial times.
John Ross, purchasing agent for the Continental Army, was born in
Tain, Ross-shire. He lost about one hundred thousand dollars by his
services to his adopted country, but managed to avoid financial
shipwreck. John Harvie, born at Gargunnock, died 1807, was Member of
the Continental Congress (1777), signer of the Articles of
Confederation the following year, and in 1788 was appointed Secretary
of the Commonwealth. John McDonnell (1779-1846), born in Scotland, was

Midlothian, took part with General Forbes in the expedition to redeem
the failure of Braddock. General John Forbes (1710-59), born in
Pittencrieff, Fifeshire, was founder of Pittsburgh. He was noted for
his obstinacy and strength of character, and may have been the
prototype of the Scotsman of the prayer: &quot;Grant, O Lord, that the
Scotchman may be right; for, if wrong, <a name="Page_31" id="Page_31" />he is eternally wrong.&quot;
Captain William Bean was the first white man to bring his family to
Tennessee. His son, Russell Bean, was the first white child born in
the state. His descendant, Dr. James Bean, died in a snowstorm on Mont
Blanc while collecting specimens for the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

<p>George Rogers Clark (1752-1818), to whose prowess is due the
possession of the territory Northwest of the Ohio, secured by the
peace of 1783, was of Scottish descent. David Crockett (1786-1836),
was most probably of the same origin, though vaguely said to be &quot;son
of an Irishman.&quot; The name is distinctly Scottish (Dumfriesshire).
Samuel McDowell (1735-1817), took an active part in the movement
leading to the War of Independence and was President of the first
State Constitutional Convention of Kentucky (1792). Colonel James
Innes, born in Canisbay, Caithness, was appointed Commander-in-Chief
of all the forces in the expedition to the Ohio in 1754 by Governor
Dinwiddie.</p>

<p>Isaac Magoon, a Scot, was the first settler of the town of Scotland
(c. 1700), and gave it the name of his native country. Dr. John
Stevenson, a Scot, pioneer merchant and developer of Baltimore, if not
indeed its actual founder, was known as the &quot;American Romulus.&quot; George
Walker, a native of Clackmannanshire, pointed out the advantages of
the present site of the Capital of the United States, and George
Buchanan, another Scot, laid out Baltimore town in 1730. John Kinzie
(1763-1828), the founder of Chicago, was born in Canada of Scottish
parentage, the son of John MacKenzie. It is not known why he dropped
the &quot;Mac.&quot; Samuel Wilkeson (1781-1848), the man who developed Buffalo
from a village to a city, was of Scottish descent. Alexander White
(1814-72), born in Elgin, Scotland, was one of the earliest settlers
of Chicago and did much to develop the city. Major Hugh McAlister, who
served in the Revolutionary War, later founded the town of
McAlisterville, Pennsylvania, was of Scots parentage. James Robertson
(1742-1814), founder of Nashville, Tennessee, was of Scottish origin.
His services are ranked next to Sevier's in the history of his adopted
state. Walter Scott Gordon (1848-86), founder of Sheffield, Alabama,
was the great-grandson of a Scot. The town of Paterson, in Putnam
county, New York, was settled by Matthew Paterson, a Scottish
stone-mason, in the middle of the eighteenth century, and was named
after him. Lairdsville, in New York state, was named from Samuel

<p>Of the colonial Governors sent from Britain to the American Colonies
before the Revolution and of Provincial Governors from that time to
1789, a large number were of Scottish birth or descent. Among them may
be mentioned the following:</p>

<p>NEW YORK. Robert Hunter, Governor (1710-19), previously Governor of
Virginia, was a descendant of the Hunters of Hunterston, Ayrshire. He
died Governor of Jamaica (1734). He was described as one of the ablest
of the men sent over from Britain to fill public positions. William
Burnet (1688-1729), Governor in 1720, was also Governor of
Massachusetts (1720-1729). He was the eldest son of Gilbert Burnet,
Bishop of Sarum. Smith, the historian of New York, calls him &quot;a man of
sense and polite breeding, a well bred scholar.&quot; John Montgomerie,
Governor of New York and New Jersey (1728-31), was born in Scotland.
John Hamilton, Governor (1736). Cadwallader Golden (1688-1776),
Lieutenant-Governor (1761-1776), born in Duns, Berwickshire, was
distinguished as physician, botanist, mathematician, and did much to
develop the resources of the state. O'Callaghan in his &quot;Documentary
History of the State of New York,&quot; says: &quot;Posterity will not fail to
accord justice to the character and memory of a man to whom this
country is most deeply indebted for much of its science and for many
of its most important institutions, and of whom the State of New York
may well be proud.&quot; John Murray, fourth Earl of Dunmore, Governor
(1770-71), afterwards Governor of Virginia. James Robertson
(1710-1788), born in Fifeshire, was Governor in 1780. Andrew Elliot,
born in Scotland in 1728, was Lieutenant-Governor and administered the
royalist government from 1781 to November, 1783.</p>

<p>NEW JERSEY. Robert Barclay of the Quaker family of Barclay of Ury was
appointed Governor of East New Jersey in 1682, but never visited his
territory. Lord Neil Campbell, son of the ninth Earl of Argyll, was
appointed Governor in 1687, but meddled little in the affairs of the
colony. Andrew Hamilton (c. 1627-1703), his deputy, born in Edinburgh,
on Lord Neil Campbell's departure, became Acting Governor. He was an
active, energetic officer, who rendered good <a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" />service to the state,
and organized the first postal service in the colonies. John Hamilton,
son of Andrew, was Acting Governor for a time and died at Perth Amboy
in 1746. William Livingston (1723-90), the &quot;Don Quixote of New
Jersey,&quot; grandson of Robert Livingston of Ancrum, Scotland, founder of
the Livingston family in America, so famous in the history of New York
State, was Governor from 1776 to 1790. William Paterson (1745-1806),
of Ulster Scot birth, studied at Princeton, admitted to the New Jersey
bar in November, 1767, Attorney-General in 1776, first Senator from
New Jersey to first Congress (1789), succeeded Livingston as Governor
(1790-92), and in 1793 became Justice of the Supreme Court. The city
of Paterson is named after him.</p>

<p>PENNSYLVANIA. Andrew Hamilton, Governor (1701-03), was previously
Governor of East and West Jersey. Sir William Keith (1680-1751), born
in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, Deputy Governor from 1717 to 1726.
Patrick Gordon (1644-1736), Governor (1726-28). James Logan
(1674-1751), born in County Armagh, son of Patrick Logan, of Scottish
parentage, was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania from
1731 to 1739, and President of the Council (1736-38). He bequeathed
his library of over two thousand volumes to Philadelphia, and they now
form the &quot;Loganian Library&quot; in the Philadelphia Public Library. James
Hamilton (c. 1710-1783), son of Andrew Hamilton, champion of the
liberty of the press, was elected Member of the Provincial Assembly
when but twenty years of age, and was re-elected five times. He was
Deputy Governor 1748-54 and 1759-63. Robert Hunter Morris, of the
famous New Jersey family of that name, Deputy Governor (1745-56).
Joseph Reed, of Ulster Scot descent, Governor (1778-81). John
Dickinson was President from 1782 to 1785.</p>

<p>DELAWARE. Dr. John McKinly (1721-96), first Governor of the state
(1777), was of Ulster Scot birth. (All the above Governors of
Pennsylvania except Reed also held the governorship of Delaware along
with that of Pennsylvania.)</p>

<p>VIRGINIA. Robert Hunter (1707). (<i>See above under New York.</i>)
Alexander Spotswood, Lieutenant-Governor (1710-22), a scion of the
Spotswood of that Ilk. He was one of the ablest and most popular
representatives of the crown authority in the Colonies and was the
principal encourager of the growth of tobacco which laid the
foundation of Virginia's wealth. Hugh Drysdale, Lieutenant-Governor
(1722-26), was strongly opposed to the introduction of slavery into
the colony. Commissary James Blair (1655-1743), President of Council
(1740-41), was born in Scotland. Robert Dinwiddie, born in Glasgow in
1693, was Governor from 1751 to 1758. He recommended <a name="Page_34" id="Page_34" />the annexation
of the Ohio Valley and so secured that great territory to the United
States. To him is also due the credit of calling George Washington to
the service of his country. Dinwiddie county is named after him. John
Campbell, Earl of Loudon (1705-82), Governor (1756-58), does not
appear to have come to this colony. John Blair, Governor (1768), son
of Dr. Archibald Blair and nephew of Rev. James Blair, the Commissary.
Many of his descendants have distinguished themselves in the annals of
Virginia. John Murray, fourth Earl of Dunmore, Governor (1771-75), was
previously Governor of New York. Patrick Henry (1736-99), Governor
(1776-79, 1784-86), was born in Hanover County, Virginia, of Scottish
parentage, his father being a native of Aberdeen, his grandmother a
cousin of William Robertson the historian. He became a lawyer in 1760
and in 1763 found his opportunity, when having been employed to plead
against an unpopular tax, his great eloquence seemed suddenly to
develop itself. This defence placed him at once in the front rank of
American orators, and in 1765 he entered the Virginia House of
Burgesses, immediately thereafter becoming leader in Virginia of the
political agitation which preceded the Declaration of Independence. On
the passage of the Stamp Act his voice was the first that rose in a
clear, bold call to resistance, and in May, 1773, he assisted in
procuring the passage of the resolution establishing a Committee of
Correspondence for intercourse with the other colonies. In the
Continental Congress which met in Philadelphia in 1774 he delivered a
fiery and eloquent speech worthy of so momentous a meeting. In 1776 he
carried the vote of the Virginia Convention for independence. He was
an able administrator, a wise and far-seeing legislator, but it is as
an orator that he will forever live in American history. William
Fleming (1729-95), surgeon, soldier, and statesman, Councillor and
Acting-Governor (1781), was born in Jedburgh, Roxburghshire.</p>

<p>NORTH CAROLINA. William Drummond, Governor of &quot;Albemarle County
Colony&quot; (i.e., North Carolina), was a native of Perthshire, a
strenuous upholder of the rights of the people, and ranks as one of
the earliest of American patriots. He took a prominent part in
&quot;Bacon's Rebellion&quot; in 1676, &quot;an insurrection that was brought about
by the insolence and pig-headedness of Sir William Berkeley, then
Governor of Virginia,&quot; and was executed the same year. Gabriel
Johnston (1699-1752), Governor (1734-52), was born in Scotland, and
held the Professorship of Oriental Languages in St. Andrews University
before coming to the colonies. Johnston County is named after him.
Matthew Rowan was President of Council and Acting Governor in 1753.
Alexander Martin (1740-1807), was fourth and Acting Governor, 1782-84,
and from 1789 to 1792. Samuel Johnston <a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" />(1733-1816), sixth Governor
(1788-89), four years Senator, and Justice of the Supreme Court from
1800-1803. Bancroft says the movement for freedom was assisted by &quot;the
calm wisdom of Samuel Johnston, a native of Dundee, in Scotland, a man
revered for his integrity, thoroughly opposed to disorder and
revolution, if revolution could be avoided without yielding to
oppression.&quot;</p>

<p>SOUTH CAROLINA. Richard Kirk, Governor (1684). James Glen, born in
Linlithgow in 1701, Governor (1743-56). Lord William Campbell, third
brother of the fifth Duke of Argyll, Governor (1775). John Rutledge
(1739-1800), brother of Edward Rutledge the Signer, was President of
South Carolina (1776-78) and first Governor (1779-82). He was later a
delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Associate Justice
of the United States Supreme Court (1789-91), Chief Justice of South
Carolina (1791-95), and in 1795 appointed Chief Justice of the United
States Supreme Court.</p>

<p>GEORGIA. William Erwin or Ewen, born in England in 1775. John Houston,
son of Sir Patrick Houston, one of the prime instigators and
organizers of the Sons of Liberty (1774), was Governor in 1774-76,
1778. His portrait was destroyed by fire during the Civil War. Houston
County was named in his honor. Edward Telfair, born in the Stewartry
of Kirkcudbright in 1735 and died at Savannah in 1807. When the
revolutionary troubles commenced he earnestly espoused the side of the
colonies, and became known locally as an ardent advocate of liberty.
He was regarded as the foremost citizen of his adopted state, and his
death was deeply mourned throughout the state.</p>

<p>FLORIDA. George Johnstone, a member of the family of Johnstone of
Westerhall, was nominal Governor of Florida when that colony was ceded
by Spain to Great Britain in 1763. He was one of the Commissioners
appointed by the British government to try and restore peace in
America in 1778.</p>

<p>Presbyterians in the Colonies, being dissenters, were untrammeled and
free to speak their mind in defence of their country's right, and
history shows that they did not fail their opportunity: the doctrine
of passive obedience never finding favor with them. In the Colonies
the Presbyterian ministers claimed equal rights, religious freedom,
and civil liberty. Their teaching had great influence, particularly in
the South, and Patrick Henry of Virginia, David Caldwell, Dr. Ephraim
Brevard, Rev. Alexander Craighead (d. 1766), and James Hall of North
Carolina, the two Rutledges and Tennant of South Carolina, William
Murdoch of Maryland, James Wilson and Thomas Craighead of
Pennsylvania, Witherspoon of New Jersey, Read and McKean of Delaware,
Livingston of New York, and Thornton of New Hampshire, with their
associates had prepared the people for the coming conflict. In
Maryland the lower house of the General Assembly was a fortress of
popular rights and of civil liberty. Its resolutions and messages,
beginning in 1733, and in an uninterrupted chain until 1755
continually declared &quot;that it is the peculiar right of his Majesty's
subjects not to be liable to any tax or other imposition but what is
laid on them by laws to which they themselves are a party.&quot; These
principles were reiterated and recorded upon the journals of every
Assembly until 1771. The resolutions, addresses, and messages of the
lower house during this period discuss with remarkable fullness and
accuracy the fundamental principles of free government, and most of
them emanated from William Murdoch, born in Scotland (c. 1720), who
was one of the leading spirits and the directing force of the
discussion. He led in the resistance to the Stamp Act and in other
ways he united his colony in solid resistance to the attempt to levy
taxes and imposts without their consent. In May, 1775, the General
Synod of the Presbyterian Church met in Philadelphia and issued its
famous &quot;Pastoral Letter,&quot; which was sent broadcast throughout the
Colonies, urging the people to adhere to the resolutions of Congress,
and to make earnest prayer to God for guidance in all measures looking
to the defense of the country. This powerful letter was also sent to
the legislature in every colony. <a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" />Adolphus in his &quot;History of England
from the Accession of George III. to the Conclusion of Peace in 1783,&quot;
published in London in 1802, declared that the Synod and their
circular was the chief cause which led the Colonies to determine on
resistance. There is no question that from the Scots Presbyterians and
their descendants came many of the leaders in the struggle for
independence, as Bancroft has well pointed out in the following words:
&quot;The first voice publicly raised in America to dissolve all connection
with Great Britain came not from the Puritans of New England, nor the
Dutch of New York, nor the planters of Virginia, but from the
Scotch-Irish Presbyterians.&quot; Joseph Galloway (1730-1803), the
Loyalist, than whom, says Ford, &quot;there could be no better informed
witness,&quot; &quot;held that the underlying cause of the American Revolution
was the activity and influence of the Presbyterian interest,&quot; and
further, that &quot;it was the Presbyterians who supplied the Colonial
resistance a lining without which it would have collapsed.&quot; And Joseph
Reed of Philadelphia, himself an Episcopalian, said: &quot;The part taken
by the Presbyterians in the contest with the mother country was
indeed, at the time, often made a ground of reproach, and the
connection between their efforts for the security of religious liberty
and opposition to the oppressive measures of Parliament, was then
distinctly seen. A Presbyterian loyalist was a thing unheard of.&quot;
Parker, the historian, quotes a writer who says: &quot;When the sages of
America came to settle the forms of our government, they did but copy
into every constitution the simple elements of representative
republicanism, as found in the Presbyterian system. It is a matter of
history that cannot be denied, that Presbyterianism as found in the
Bible and the standards of the several Presbyterian churches, gave
character to our free institutions.&quot; Ranke, the German historian,
declared that &quot;Calvin was the founder of the American Government;&quot; and
Gulian C. Verplanck of New York, in a public address, traced the
origin of our Declaration of Independence to the National Covenant of
Scotland. Chief Justice Tilghman (1756-1827) stated that the framers
of the Constitution of the United States were through the agency of
Dr. Witherspoon much indebted to the standards of the Presbyterian
Church of Scotland in molding that instrument.</p>

<p>Of the fifty-six Signers of the Declaration of Independence, no less
than nine can be claimed as directly or indirectly of Scottish origin.
Edward Rutledge (1749-1800), the youngest Signer, was a son of Dr.
John Rutledge who emigrated from Ulster to South Carolina in 1735. The
Rutledges were a small Border clan in Roxburghshire. William Hooper
(1742-1790), was the son of a Scottish minister, who was born near
Kelso and died in Boston in 1767. Hooper early displayed marked
literary ability and entered Harvard University when fifteen years of
age. At twenty-six he was one of the leading lawyers of the colony of
North Carolina. George Ross (1730-79), was also of Scottish parentage.
His nephew's wife, Elizabeth (Griscom) Ross (1752-1832), better known
as &quot;Betsy Ross,&quot; was maker of the first national flag. Matthew
Thornton (1714-1803), the distinguished New Hampshire statesman and
physician, was brought to this country from the north of Ireland by
his father when about three years of age. He accompanied the
expedition against Louisburg in 1745, was President of the Provincial
Convention in 1775 and Speaker in January, 1776. In September, 1776,
he was elected to Congress, and in November following signed the
Declaration of Independence, although he had not been one of the
framers. Thomas McKean (1734-1817), was a great-grandson of William
McKean of Argyllshire who moved to Ulster about the middle of the
seventeenth century. He was a member of Congress from Delaware
(1774-83), Chief Justice of Pennsylvania (1777-99), and Governor of
the state from 1799 to 1808. George Taylor (1716-81), described as the
son of a clergyman and &quot;born in Ireland,&quot; was most probably an Ulster
Scot. He was a member of the Provincial Assembly of Pennsylvania from
1764 to 1770 and again in 1775. James Wilson (1742-1798), whose fame
was to become as wide and lasting as the nation, was born in St.
Andrews, the old university city of Fifeshire. He was a Delegate to
Congress from Pennsylvania in 1776, Member of the Constitutional
Convention of 1787, and Associate Justice of the United States Supreme
Court from 1789 till his death. He strongly advocated independence as
the only possible means of escape from the evils which <a name="Page_39" id="Page_39" />had brought
the various commonwealths into such a state of turmoil and
dissatisfaction. Philip Livingston (1716-1778), grandson of Robert
Livingston, the first of the American family of the name, was Member
of Congress from New York in 1776. &quot;His life was distinguished for
inflexible rectitude and devotion to the interests of his country.&quot;</p>

<p>Last but greatest of all to be mentioned is the Rev. John Witherspoon
(1722-94). Born in Yester, Scotland, educated in Edinburgh, minister
in Paisley, he was called in 1768 to be President of the College of
New Jersey, now Princeton University. He said he had &quot;become an
American the moment he landed.&quot; He took an active part in the public
affairs of the colony of New Jersey, and in the convention which met
to frame a constitution he displayed great knowledge of legal
questions and urged the abolition of religious tests. In June, 1776,
he was elected to the Continental Congress, and in the course of the
debates he displayed little patience with those who urged half
measures. When John Dickinson of Pennsylvania said the country was not
ripe for independence, Witherspoon broke in upon the speaker
exclaiming, &quot;Not ripe, Sir! In my judgment we are not only ripe, but
rotting. Almost every colony has dropped from its parent stem and your
own province needs no more sunshine to mature it.&quot; He further declared
that he would rather be hanged than desert his country's cause. One of
his sons was killed at the battle of Germantown.</p>

<p>Of the twenty-nine Presidents of the United States five (Monroe,
Grant, Hayes, Roosevelt, and Wilson) are of Scottish descent, and four
(omitting Jackson who has been also claimed as Scottish by some
writers) are of Ulster Scot descent, namely, Polk, Buchanan, Arthur,
and McKinley. Jackson may possibly have been of Ulster Scot descent as
his father belonged to Carrickfergus while his, mother's maiden name,
Elizabeth Hutchins, or Hutchinson, is Scottish. She came of a family
of linen weavers. Benjamin Harrison might also have been included as
he had some Scottish (Gordon) blood. His wife, Caroline Scott
Harrison, was of Scottish descent.</p>

<p>James Monroe, fifth President, was descended from Andrew Monroe, who
emigrated from Scotland in the middle of the seventeenth century.
President Grant was a descendant of Matthew Grant, who came from
Scotland to Dorchester, Mass., in 1630. George Hayes, ancestor of
Rutherford B. Hayes, nineteenth President, was a Scot who settled in
Windsor prior to 1680. Theodore Roosevelt was Dutch on his father's
side and Scottish on his mother's. His mother was descended from James
Bulloch, born in Scotland about 1701, who emigrated to Charleston, c.
1728, and founded a family which became prominent in the annals of
Georgia. Woodrow Wilson's paternal grandfather, James Wilson, came
from county Down in 1807. His mother, Janet (or Jessie) Woodrow, was a
daughter of Rev. Thomas Woodrow, a native of Paisley, Scotland. James
Knox Polk, eleventh President, was a great-great-grandson of Robert
Polk or Pollok, who came from Ayrshire through Ulster. Many kinsmen of
President Polk have distinguished themselves in the annals of this
country. James Buchanan, fifteenth President, was of Ulster Scot
parentage. Chester Alan Arthur, twenty-first President, was the son of
a Belfast minister of Scottish descent. William McKinley, twenty-fifth
President, was descended from David McKinley, an Ulster Scot, born
about 1730, and his wife, Rachel Stewart. The surname McKinley in
Ireland occurs only in Ulster Scot territory.</p>

(1873-75). His original name was Jeremiah Jones Colbraith (i.e.,
Galbraith). He was also a distinguished author, his most important
work being the &quot;History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in
America&quot; (1872-75). Thomas Andrews Hendricks (1819-85), who held the
Vice-Presidency only for a few months (March to November, 1885), was

<p>William Maclure (1763-1840), the &quot;Father of American Geology,&quot; <a name="Page_69" id="Page_69" />was
born in Ayr, Scotland, and after acquiring a fortune in London, he
came in 1796 to the United States. Having studied geology in Europe he
was attracted by the imposing scale of the geological structure of his
adopted country, and in the course of some years made many journeys
across the eastern states. He recorded his geological observations on
a map, and in 1809 communicated his researches to the American
Philosophical Society. In 1817, having extended his knowledge during
the intervening eight years he presented his map to the Society, and
it was then published. This was the first geological survey of the
United States, and it was carried out unsustained by government aid or
patronage. It was also chiefly through Maclure's aid that the new
Academy of Sciences in Philadelphia was built and endowed. Dr.
Archibald Bruce (1777-1818), the first scientific mineralogist in
America, and founder of the <i>American Mineralogical Magazine</i> (1810),
was born in New York city, son of Dr. William Bruce, head of the
medical department of the British Armies. Henry Darwin Rogers

Wisconsin and Iowa, and that of Minnesota in 1852. His brother,
Richard Owen (1810-90), also born in Lanarkshire, had a distinguished
career in this country as a geologist. J. Peter Lesley (1819-1903),
also of Scottish descent, was another distinguished geologist who by
his researches and surveys in Pennsylvania, vastly aided in the
economic development of that state. Persifor Frazer (1844-1909), son
of John Fries Frazer and great-grandson of Lieutenant-Colonel Persifor
Frazer of Revolutionary times, was author of the Geological Survey of
Pennsylvania (5 vols.) William John McGee (1853-1912), geologist and
anthropologist, claimed descent from the MacGregors. He was Geologist
of the United States Geological Survey from 1883 to 1893, Ethnologist
in Charge of the Bureau of Ethnology from 1893 to 1903, and in 1907
was appointed a Member of the Inland Waterways Commission. Washington
Carruthers Kerr (1827-85), educator and scientist of Ulster Scot
parentage, was State Geologist of North Carolina (1866-82), and
published many papers and reports on his subject. John Muir
(1838-1914), geologist, explorer, naturalist, and author, was born in
Dunbar. &quot;No <a name="Page_70" id="Page_70" />man since Thoreau ever had keener sympathy with nature, a
quicker vision for her mysteries, or a surer speech for their
interpretation.&quot; The establishment of the Yosemite and Sequoia
National Parks and the great Sierra Forest Reservation are due to his
writings. The famous Muir Glacier in Alaska, discovered by him in
1879, will forever blazon his name. Other distinguished geologists who
may be briefly mentioned are: Samuel Calvin (1840-1911), Professor of
Geology in the University of Iowa, born in Wigtownshire; John James
Stevenson (b. 1841), educator and geologist, of Scottish parentage;
Erwin Hinckly Barbour (b. 1856), professor of Geology in the
University of Nebraska; and William Berryman Scott (b. 1858), the
distinguished geologist and pal&aelig;ontologist of Princeton University.</p>

<p>Asa Gray (1810-88), the greatest of American botanists, was a
descendant of one of the Ulster Scot settlers of 1718. Dr. Alexander
Garden (1728-92), famous as a physician and botanist, was Professor of
Botany in King's College (now Columbia University). His son was a
distinguished Revolutionary officer. Thomas Huston Macbride (b. 1848),
President Emeritus of the State University of Iowa, who has written
much of value on botany, is of Scottish ancestry. Beverly Thomas
Galloway (b. 1863), descended from John Galloway, an emigrant from
Scotland in 1680, Chief of the Division of Plant Industry of the
United States Department of Agriculture, Assistant Secretary of
Agriculture in 1913-14, is the author of several works on plant
diseases. David Trembly Macdougal (b. 1865), Director of the Botanical
Research Department of the Carnegie Institution of Washington since
1905, is the grandson of a Scottish immigrant. His studies relate
especially to plant physiology, heredity, and organic evolution.</p>

Canal, was born in Perthshire. He was later Assistant Astronomer at
the United States Naval Observatory, and discovered three asteroids,
for which he received medals from the French Academy of Sciences.
Ormsby McKnight Mitchel (1810-62), who was Director of the Cincinnati
Observatory (1845) and later of the Dudley Observatory (1859),
inventor of the chronograph and other astronomical apparatus, and
became a General in the Civil War, was probably also of Scottish
origin. Maria Mitchell (1818-89), daughter of William Mitchell
(1791-1868), also an astronomer, became Professor of Astronomy in
Vassar College, LL.D. of Columbia University (1887), and was the first
woman elected to the American <a name="Page_71" id="Page_71" />Academy of Sciences. Lewis Morris
Rutherfurd (1816-92), one of the most distinguished astronomers on the
American Continent, obtained important results in astronomical
photography, and by means of a ruling engine, designed by him in 1870,
constructed the finest diffraction-gratings which had, up to that
time, been made, was of Scottish ancestry. George Davidson
(1825-1911), born in England of Scottish parentage, geodetist and
astronomer, one of the founders of the Geographical Society of the
Pacific, Regent of the University of California, was retired after
fifty years' active field service of incalculable value to the cause
of science. William Harkness (1837-1903), born in Ecclefechan,
Dumfriesshire, was executive officer of the Transit of Venus
Commission (1882). The task of reducing the observations and the
hundreds of photographs was successfully undertaken by him although
declared impossible by eminent British and German astronomers. He was
later Astronomical Director of the Naval Observatory and in 1897 made
head of the Nautical Almanac. Williamina (Mina) Paton Fleming
(1857-1911), born in Dundee, discovered many new stars and wrote much
of permanent value on her subject. William Wallace Campbell (b. 1862),
of Scottish ancestry, has been Director of Lick Observatory since
1901, and has written much on astronomy.</p>

<p>The most interesting Scot in connection with horticulture in the
United States is Grant Thorburn (1773-1861), who was born in Dalkeith
and left his native country for political reasons in 1794. After
trying a number of occupations he finally established himself as a
seed merchant in New York, and the business is still carried on under
his name. Under the pen name of &quot;Lawrie Todd&quot; he contributed to the
<i>Knickerbocker Magazine</i> and other New York periodicals, and supplied
John Galt, the novelist, with much of the information incorporated in
his &quot;Lawrie Todd; or, Settlers in the New World.&quot; Thorburn also
published two volumes of reminiscences, &quot;Forty Years' Residence in
America,&quot; and &quot;Fifty Years' Reminiscences of New York.&quot; William Adair,
born near Glasgow in 1815, developed a profitable business as gardener
and horticulturist in Michigan, and served as State Senator from 1861
to 1865, 1869-70. Peter Henderson (1822-90), born at Pathhead near
Edinburgh, founded the firm of Peter Henderson and Co.,
horticulturists and seedsmen, one of the largest firms of its kind in
existence. William Saunders (1822-1900), born in St. Andrews, planted
and laid out several large estates, beautified Fairmount and Hunting
Parks in Philadelphia, and the park and garden system of Washington,
D.C., the National Cemetery at Gettysburg, etc. William Macmillan,
born in Nairnshire, laid out the public parks of Buffalo, and William
R. Smith, a native of Haddingtonshire, <a name="Page_72" id="Page_72" />was for many years
Superintendent of the Botanic Gardens at Washington. Robert Buist

Charleston, S.C., in 1730, gained a large practice through his skill
as a physician, and a distinguished reputation in Europe as a
scientist from his experiments in electricity, etc. His meteorological
observations were probably the first ever published. In 1751 he issued
his &quot;History of the Yellow Fever,&quot; &quot;which was the first that had been
given to the public from the American continent.&quot; Dr. Lionel Chalmers
(1715-1777), born in Argyllshire, practised in South Carolina for more
than forty years, and was the first to treat of the soil, climate,
weather, and diseases of that state. He &quot;left behind him the name of a
skilful, humane physician.&quot; Dr. James Craik (1731-1814),
physician-general of the United States Army, was born at Arbigland,
near Dumfries, and for nearly forty years was the intimate friend of
Washington, and his physician in his last illness. One of the earliest
introducers of vaccination into America and an original investigator
into the cause of disease was Dr. John Crawford (1746-1813), of Ulster
Scots birth. As early as 1790 he had conceived what is now known as
the germ theory of disease. Dr. Adam Stephen, born in Scotland, died
at Martinsburg, West Virginia, in 1791, took part in the French and
Indian wars and was an active participant in the Revolutionary War on

College, and his grandson was George McClellan (1849-1913), the
eminent Philadelphia anatomist. Dr. Peter Middleton (d. 1781), a
native of Scotland, made the first dissection on record in this
country before a class of students and in 1767 established a Medical
School in New York which was subsequently merged in the King's (now
Columbia) College. Dr. William Currie (1754-1823), served in the
medical service during the Revolutionary War, and was reputed one of
the most gifted men of his time as physician and classical scholar.

no parallel.&quot; William Thomas Green Morton (1819-68), the discoverer of
anaesthesia, was also of Scottish origin. Dr. Robert Alexander Kinloch
(1826-91), of Scottish parentage, was the first American surgeon to
resect the knee joint for chronic cases, also the first to treat
fractures of the lower jaw and other bones by wiring the fragments,
and was also the first in any country to perform a laparotomy for
gunshot wounds in the abdomen without protrusion of the viscera. Dr.
George Troup Maxwell (1827-1879), was inventor of the laryngoscope.
James Ridley Taylor (1821-1895), who entered the medical profession
after middle life, at the end of a long career passed as a mechanical
engineer, and achieved success and fame in his profession, was born in
Ayr, Scotland. He probably inherited his mechanical skill from his
uncle, John Taylor of Dalswinton, who constructed the steam engine
along with Symington. James Henry McLean (1829-86), physician and
Member of Congress, was born in Scotland. Dr. James Craig (1834-88),

<p>The Scots have largely contributed to raise the standard of education
and culture in the United States. They furnished most of the principal
schoolmasters in the Revolutionary Colonies south of New York, and
many of the Revolutionary leaders were trained by them. While Harvard
still continued under the charge of a president and tutors and had but
one &quot;professor,&quot; William and Mary College had had for many years a
full faculty of professors, graduates of the Scottish and English
universities. The Scots established the &quot;Log College&quot; at Nashaminy,
Pennsylvania, Jefferson College, Mercer College, Wabash College, and
Dickinson College; and in many places, before the cabins disappeared
from the roadside and the stumps from the fields, a college was
founded. The &quot;Log College&quot; was the seed from which Princeton College
sprang. The University for North Carolina, founded and nurtured by
Scots in 1793, and the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton
University are indebted to the same source for their present position.
William Gordon and Thomas Gordon, who founded a free school in the
county of Middlesex, Virginia, in the latter half of the seventeenth
century, were Scots; and Hugh Campbell, another Scot, an
Attorney-at-law in Norfolk county, Virginia, in 1691, deeded two
hundred acres of land in each of the counties of Norfolk, Isle of
Wight, and Nansemond, for free schools. James Innes, who came to
America from Canisbay, Caithness, in 1734, by his will gave his
plantation, a considerable personal estate, his library, and one
hundred pounds &quot;for the use of a free school for the benefit of the
youth of North Carolina,&quot; the first private bequest for education in
the state. One of the first public acts of Gabriel Johnston,
Provincial Governor of North Carolina (1734-52), was to insist upon
the need of making adequate provision for a thorough school system in
the colony. Out of the host of names which present themselves in this
field of public service we have room only for the following:</p>

American artists who have successfully painted the nude. His
water-colors and etchings have brought him high reputation in these
forms of expression.&quot; Walter MacEwen, born in Chicago of Scottish

<p>As Scotland gave to the world the knowledge of the art of logarithms,
the steam engine, the electric telegraph, the wireless telegraph,
illuminating gas, the knowledge of chloroform, and many other
important inventions, it was to be expected that the inventive faculty
of her sons would not fail when transplanted to this country.</p>

Later he organized the Lee Arms Company of Connecticut. The production
of the telephone as a practical and now universally employed method of
&quot;annihilating time and space&quot; in the articulate intercourse of the
human race will forever be associated with the name of Alexander
Graham Bell, born in Edinburgh in 1847. By its means he has promoted
commerce, created new industries, and has bridged continents, all the
result of &quot;sheer hard thinking aided by unbounded genius.&quot; To Dr.
Graham Bell we are also indebted for the photophone, for the inductoin
balance, the telephone probe, and the gramophone. During the war he
designed a &quot;submarine chaser&quot; capable of traveling under water at a
speed of over seventy miles an hour, and he has made important
experiments in the field of aeronautics and in other arts and
sciences. The mother of Thomas Alva Edison (b. 1847), it may here be

remarkable and many of the guiding spirits among America's successful
business men are Scots or men of Scottish descent.</p>

established the first type-foundry in Philadelphia in 1787. Their firm
cast the types for a portion of the American edition of the
<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, reprinted in Philadelphia in 1791.
Archibald Binny, (1763-1838), born in Portobello, near Edinburgh, and
James Ronaldson (d. 1841), also born in Scotland, succeeded to and
carried on the business established by Baine. In 1797 they cast the
first $ sign used in this country. The quality and art of their
product was in no wise inferior to the European and the sale of
foreign made types ceased shortly after they established their
business. Their foundry kept pace with the growth of the country and
in the seventies of last century became the best and most extensive
letter-foundry in the world. Archibald <a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" />Binny loaned the United States
Government the sum of 50,000 dollars for use in the war of 1812-14.
Ronaldson was first president of the Franklin Institute in
Philadelphia (1824-41), an institution in which he took a great
interest, and in 1831 presented to Philadelphia the beautiful cemetery
bearing his name. He was described as &quot;an upright, frugal and honest
man, and a lover of his adopted country.&quot; George Bruce (1781-1866),
born in Edinburgh, along with his brother David introduced the art of
stereotyping, the secret of which David secured in Edinburgh. In 1816
they purchased a foundry for type making and stereotyping, and George
Bruce in his seventy-eighth year of age produced type which has rarely
been excelled for beauty of design and neatness of finish. &quot;He did
much toward facilitating American printing and towards making it a
fine art, inventing, with the assistance of his nephew, David Bruce,
Jr., a successful type-casting machine which has come into general
use.&quot; Thomas Mackellar (1812-1899), printer and poet, also one of the
leading type founders, was of Scottish parentage. William Vincent
McKean, born in 1820 of Ulster Scot descent, was another distinguished
type-founder and editor-in-chief of the <i>Philadelphia Public Ledger</i>
for many years. Another individual who may be included under this head
is Adam Ramage who was born in Scotland and died at an advanced age in
Philadelphia in 1850. He was distinguished as a manufacturer of
printing presses in the beginning of last century, and patented the
&quot;Ramage&quot; press in 1818.</p>

<p>Many names mentioned in other sections apply equally to New York city
but for lack of space they are not here again referred to. David
Jamison, one of the early Colonial lawyers in New York, was born in
Scotland. In 1707 he defended Francis Makemie, the Presbyterian
clergyman, when he was arrested for preaching in the city without a
license, and in 1710 he became Chief Justice of New Jersey. James
Graham (died c. 1700), Recorder of the city, was also a native of
Scotland. John Watts (1749-1836), of Scots parentage, was the last
Royal Recorder of the city, Speaker of the New York Assembly, Member
of Congress, 1793-96, and founder of the Leake and Watts Orphan
Asylum. Archibald Gracie, born in Dumfries, emigrated to America about
1778. Through his business enterprise he largely developed the
commercial importance of the port of New York. He was also founder of
the first Savings Bank in America, founder of the Lying-in Hospital of
the Cedar Street Presbyterian Church, President of the Chamber of
Commerce for twenty years, etc. Cadwallader David Golden (1769-1834),
grandson of Cadwallader Colden, was Mayor of the city from 1818 to
1821, and made an enviable record in that office. James Lenox
(1800-80), merchant, philanthropist, bibliophile, and founder of the
Lenox Library, now incorporated in the New York Public Library, was
one of the most useful citizens New York ever possessed. His public
benefactions were numerous, but only the largest were made public.
Among these were the Lenox Library, formerly at Fifth Avenue and
Seventieth Street; the Presbyterian Hospital, and liberal endowments
to Princeton University and Princeton Theological Seminary. Alexander
Turney Stewart (1803-76), merchant and philanthropist, born in Ireland
of Scots parents, established the great dry goods business now owned
by John Wanamaker. He was nominated as Secretary of the Treasury
(1869) but was not confirmed. Hugh Maxwell (1787-1873), born in
Paisley, was Assistant Junior Advocate General in 1814, District
Attorney for the city from 1819 to 1829, and Collector of the Port
(1849-52). Robert L. Stuart (1806-82) and his brother Alexander
(1810-79), sugar refiners, both gave large sums, estimated at over two
million dollars, to many charities, and the library, pictures, <a name="Page_114" id="Page_114" />and
mineral and shell collections of the former are preserved in a
separate room of the New York Public Library. Hugh Auchincloss
(1817-90) and John Auchincloss, his brother, sons of Hugh Auchincloss
of Paisley, were prominent merchants in the city. Robert Lenox Kennedy
(b. 1822), banker and public spirited citizen, grandson of a Scot, was
President of the Trustees of the New York Public Library, an
institution largely Scottish in its foundation and endowment. James
Gibb, born in Scotland in 1829, a successful merchant, was President
of Brooklyn Park Commission. James Cruikshank (b. 1831), of Scottish
descent, was noted for his activity in furthering education in
Brooklyn. Abram Stevens Hewitt (1822-1903), of Scottish parentage, was
Member of Congress from New York (1875-79, 1881-86), and Mayor of the
city (1887-88). John Stewart Kennedy (1830-1909), financier and
philanthropist, born at Blantyre, near Glasgow, gave one million
dollars to the Presbyterian Hospital as his golden wedding anniversary
gift, five hundred thousand dollars to Columbia University, besides
innumerable gifts to other institutions. His will left over
sixty-seven million dollars, nearly half of it for charitable
purposes. Alexander Ector Orr (1831-1914), President of New York Rapid
Transit Commission, Vice-President of many financial institutions, was
of Ulster Scot descent. Thomas Fitchie (1834-1905), of Scottish
parentage, was an earnest worker for purity in civil life in Brooklyn.
Charles A. Lamont (1835-1904), son of Neil Lamont from Scotland, was
one of the original members of the Republican Party and of the Union
League prominent in city affairs. He was the originator of the Ramapo
scheme of water supply for the city. Robert Maclay (b. 1836), of
Scottish parentage, was President of the Knickerbocker Ice Company
(1875), Commissioner of Education, Rapid Transit Commissioner, etc.
Dr. Albert Prescott Marble (1836-1906), a recognized leader in
educational matters, President of the Board of Superintendents of the
New York Department of Education, was a descendant of one of the Scots
settlers of Maine. Robert Macy Galloway (b. 1837), merchant and
banker, had a considerable part in developing the elevated railroads
of the city. Eugene Gilbert Blackford (1839-1904), merchant and
ichthyologist, of Scottish descent, &quot;did more to advance the interests
of fish culture in this country than any other man.&quot; He wrote much on
the subject and to his efforts was due the creation of the Aquarium at
the Battery. Alexander Taylor, born in Leith, Scotland, in 1821, was
founder of the firm of Alexander Taylor's Sons. Walter Scott, managing
Director of Butler Brothers, born in Canada, of Scottish parentage, is
widely known as a liberal promoter of education, art, athletics, and
patriotism.</p>

<p>That the Scots in America have not been solely devoted to business and
the promotion of their own selfish welfare is evidenced by the
remarkable growth of their numerous Societies based upon the extension
of fellowship among Scots in the New World and for the collection and
distribution of charitable funds among the poor and needy of their
countrymen. The oldest of these Societies, the Scots' Charitable
Society of Boston, was founded January 6, 1657, with twenty-seven
members. It was followed by the St. Andrew's Club of Charleston, S.C.
(the first to bear the name of St. Andrew), 1729; the St. Andrew's
Society of Philadelphia, December 7, 1749; the St. Andrew's Society of
Savannah, Ga., 1750; the St. Andrew's Society of the Province,
afterward of the State of New York, November 19, 1756; and the St.
Andrew's Society of Albany, N.Y., November 10, 1803; until at the
present time, there is no city of any size or importance in the
country that does not have its St. Andrew's Society, or Burns or
Caledonian Club, which serves to keep alive the memories of the
home-land, to instil patriotism toward the adopted country, and to aid
the distressed among their kinsfolk. There are now more than one
thousand of these Societies in America, including the Order of
Scottish Clans (organized, 1878) a successful fraternal, patriotic and
beneficial order, with more than one hundred separate clans, and the
Daughters of Scotia, a rapidly growing order for women of Scottish
blood, organized in 1898.</p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION" /><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" />CONCLUSION</h2>


<p>&quot;It is the knowledge that Scotsmen have done their share in building
up the great Republic that makes them proud of its progress and
inspires them to add to its glories and advantages in every way.
Scotsmen, as a nationality, are everywhere spoken of as good and loyal
citizens, while Americans who can trace a family residence of a
century in the country are proud if they can count among their
ancestors some one who hailed from the land of Burns, and it is a
knowledge of all this, in turn, that makes the American Scot of to-day
proud of his country's record and his citizenship and impels him to be
as devoted to the new land as it was possible for him to have been to
the old had he remained in it. In America, the old traditions, the old
blue flag with its white cross, the old Doric, are not forgotten, but
are nourished, and preserved, and honored, and spoken by Scotsmen on
every side with the kindliest sentiments on the part of those to whom
they are alien. Americans know and acknowledge that the traditions and
flag and homely speech have long been conserved to the development of
that civil and religious liberty on which the great confederation of
sovereign republican States has been founded. In the United States,
Sir Walter Scott has more readers and quite as enthusiastic admirers
as in Scotland, and if Americans were asked which of the world's poets
came nearest to their hearts, the answer would undoubtedly be&mdash;Robert
Burns.&quot;</p>

Proofreading Team.


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
